# My first day on GitHub

Today I learned that _version control_ is an **essential part** of my career as web developer.

Some keywords that I should remember for later are:

- git,
- GitHub,
- version control,
- repository,
- commit
- and hash.

> The next 3 months will be a very exciting time, as I will learn new things every day.
